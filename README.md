# Usage

## Theme options

You can customise Nimbus' appearance in a bunch of different ways to suit your sites purpose. To do so from the dashboard navigate to Appearance > Themes and click 'Customize'. From the front-end you can access theme customization from the admin bar.

* Site Title & Tagline - Change your site title & tagline.
* Colors - Change theme colors such as background, text, link etc
* Layout - Position the sidebar on the left or the right
* Typography - Choose from preset typographical configurations
* Background Image - Change the background image
* Navigation - Specify which menu to use in the menu location
* Static Front Page - Optionally specify a static front page

## Post format - link

The link post format is automatically converted to markup. Put the anchor text as the post title and the URL as the post content.

## WooCommerce

Nimbus has been prepared for use with [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/). For now this is _simple preparation_, that means the layout will work, but styles will be inherited from the woocommerce.css file within WooCommerce. This may not mesh too nicely depending on which color scheme you configure. Light color schemes will work best.
